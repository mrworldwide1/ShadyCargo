Simply adds illegal-themed cargo without changing any default ones or adding new skins/trailers. No fines, border inspections, payments, etc. are changed in any way, however they're worth slightly more for realism.
- Narcotics
- Bootleg DVDs
- Counterfeit ID
- Firearms
- Organs
- Migrants
- Moonshine (fragile)

Only general logistics/shipping companies will accept them.

Common sense but this mod is just for fun; please don't actually buy or smuggle illegal items
