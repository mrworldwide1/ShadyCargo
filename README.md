Simply adds illegal-themed cargo without changing any default ones or adding new skins/trailers. No fines, border inspections, etc. are changed in any way, however they're worth slightly more for realism. Only general logistics/shipping companies will accept them:
- Narcotics
- Bootleg DVDs
- Counterfeit ID
- Firearms
- Organs
- Migrants
- Moonshine (fragile)

**Compatability:**
Should be compatible with any other cargo mod - tested & works on 1.50

Common sense but this mod is just for fun; I do not condone buying or smuggling any real illegal items
