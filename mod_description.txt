Simply adds illegal-themed cargo without changing any default ones or adding new skins/trailers. No fines, border inspections, payments, etc. are changed in any way, however the included ones are slightly higher paying for realism:
- Narcotics
- Bootleg DVDs
- Counterfeit ID
- Firearms
- Organs
- Migrants
- Moonshine

Common sense but don't actually buy or smuggle illegal items such as those
